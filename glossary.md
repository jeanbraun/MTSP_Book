Asthenosphere
  A weak layer located at the base of the lithosphere that lubricates the motion of tectonic plates. It corresponds to the region in the Earth where the geotherm is closest to the solidus. It may be partially molten in places.

Dimensionless number
  Dimensionless number are used by physicists to express or analyze the behaviour of a partial differential equation representing the competition between two or more physical processes, as a function of the equations parameters and boundary conditions. They are always defined as a combination of model parameters, model size or boundary condition values such that they are unitless.

Drainage area
  The upstream area that contributes to discharge by collecting rainfall. The drainage area can be quantified at any point of the landscape from the geometry (height) of the topography. Several algorithms are used to extract it from a DEM (Digital Elevation Model) by making different assumptions on how the flow of water accumulates from one point of the DEM to its neighbour(s).

Dynamic topography
  Topography generated by the divergent flow of material in the Earth's mantle against its uppermost, more rigid layer , the lithosphere. The divergence in flow creates a stress or force that is balanced by the gravitational stress or force caused by the extra topography.

Flexural isostasy
  Based on the assumption that the lithosphere behaves as a thin elastic plate tyhat is capable of supporting some of the horizontal differential stress caused by surface topography variations through bending.

Geotherm
  The distribution or variation of temperature as a function of depth in the Earth's interior.

Invariant
  A scalar quantity that is constructed from the components of a tensor and that remains invariant in any system of reference.

Isostasy
  A physical principle that is equivalent to Archimede's principle applied to the Earth lithosphere or crust.

Lithosphere
  The uppermost rigid layer of the Earth that has a plate-like behaviour; its base can be defined by an isotherm, a viscosity or a seismic wave velocity.

Numerical model
  A representation of a physical system through the use of {term}`partial differential equation`s (PDEs) and their numerical solution, i.e., through the use of techniques that transform the PDEs into algebraic equations that can be solved using a computer.

Partial differential equation
  A type of equation that combines the various derivatives, i.e., with respect to different variables, of an unknown quantity that describes the behaviour of a physical system. Because it only describes variations in the unknown quantity it must be associated with boundary and initial conditions. It is often abbreviated by the acronym PDE.

Rheology
  A relationship between deformation and stress that is used to describe and parameterize the mechanical behavious of a material. Examples of rheologies, include the viscous, elasti or plastic rheologies.
