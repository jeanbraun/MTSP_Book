# What controls the height of mountain belts on Earth?

This reading course addresses the question of what controls the height of mountain belts. Is it the strength of the {term}`lithosphere` compared to the weight of the topography, the efficiency of erosion (and thus a function of climate) or the rate at which plates move at the Earth's surface.

To illustrate this point, let's look at a picture taken from space where we can appreciate how smooth the Earth's surface is. On Earth, the range of surface topography is under 10 km compared to the Earth's radius of 6371 km. A ratio of approximately 1/600 making the Earth's relief about the size of the imperfection in an orange peal compared to its size.

```{dropdown} What is the stress caused by 1 km of surface topography?
The stress caused by a topography $\Delta h$ is equal to $\sigma=\rho g \Delta h$ where $\rho$ is rock density and $g$ the gravitational acceleration. Thus, assuming a value of 9.81 for $g$ and that surface rocks have a density of approximately 2400 $kg/m^3$, a 1000 m high topography causes a stress equal to:
$\sigma = 2400\times 9.81 \times 1000 = 23.544$ MPa.

By comparison, Iapetus, one of Saturn's satellites with a radius of only 734 km, displays a 13km-high equatorial ridge, yielding a relief/radius ratio of approximaelty 1/50. Is it due to the reduced gravity and thus weight of topography or to the absence of an atmosphere and thus of erosion processes that is responsible for this much taller relative relief?

This question can be asked at the planetary scale but the answer is also highly relevant to understand the variability in mountain height at the Earth's surface. The Earth's topography is characterized by relatively flat and low-elevation continental interiors with narrow high-elevation mountain belts around their bondaries where plates have collided in the recent geological past. Examples of such orogenic belts include the European Alps, the Pyrenees, the Himalayas, the Cordillera or the Southern Alps of New Zealand. But there exist also extensive continental areas called plateaus that are characterized by high elevation and low relief. Examples of plateaus include the Tibetan plateau, the Altiplano but also the south African plateau.

We like to classify topography in two categories: the topography that is related to variations in crustal thickness through the principle of {term}`isostasy` and the topography that is not correlated to variations in crustal thickness and is thus considered to be caused not by tectonic plate interactions (collision or extension) but by flow in the underlying convective mantle. This later type of topography is usual termed {term}`dynamic topography`, in contrast to the former called isostatic or tectonic topography.

In this course we will use a relatively small number of articles that each proposes a different hypothesis for the control of orogenic topography. It is important that participants read these articles and prepare a set of notes where they will not only summarize the main findings or conclusions but also the hypothesis that were made and the tools that were used.

In the context of this course, I have selected four papers that use numerical modeling as the main tool to support or develop their hypothesis. Furthermore, most papers quantify their hypothesis by introducing and assessing the value of a {term}`dimensionless number`.

I will end this introduction by highlighting the **main objectives** of the reading course:
1. to demonstrate the usefulness of numerical models in addressing important questions
2. to understand what dimensionless numbers are and how they can be used to understand system behaviour
3. to improve your research skills, and in particular:
	* how to read a scientific paper
	* how to take part in a scientific debate
	* how to present scientific results
