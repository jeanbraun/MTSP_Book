# Hypothesis 1

The first hypothesis that we will consider here on what controls the height of mountain belts can be found/summarized in the paper by {cite:t}`england1982thin-224`.

This hypothesis is derived from a [thin-sheet model](thin-sheet-section) that the authors developed to represent the large-scale deformation of the continental {term}`lithosphere <lithosphere>` during continental collision and applied to the Indian-Asian collision and the formation of the Hymalayas and Tibetan plateau.

:class: tip

````{tab-set}

```{tab-item} Argand number
The authors use the partial differential equation representing the viscous deformation of the {term}`lithosphere <lithosphere>` to derive a [dimensionless number](dimension-section), the Argand number, $\mathbf{Ar}$. Can you understand the way it has been derived? Can you explain what it measures?
```

```{tab-item} Non-linear rheology
The authors also stress the importance of the non-linearity of the {term}`rheology <rheology>` they use. How is it parameterized? What happens if the rheology is linear?
```

```{tab-item} Main results
Can you list the main results of the papers in a few dot points? Can you associate a figure to each of these findings?
```

```{tab-item} Himalayas
How does the model results compare to the Himalayas + Tibetan plateau system? What can be inferred from this comparison concerning the {term}`rheology <rheology>` of the lithosphere? The value of the Argand number?
```

```{tab-item} Contribution
What is the contribution of this paper to the debate concerning the height of mountain belts? What is the main hypothesis that they contribute to? Can you complete the following statement:
> According to {cite:t}`england1982thin-224`, the height of mountain belts is controlled by ...
