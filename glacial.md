# Glacial erosion

## Quaternary climate

The Quaternary is a relatively recent period of the geological past that has seen many parts of the continents, and especailly many mountain belts, being affected by ice sheets and glaciers. This is in response to the slow but steady cooling of the Earth's climate over the past $\approx60$ Myrs.

Quaternary glaciations take place over glacial cycles that are dictated by subtle variations in the Earth's orbital parameters that are called Milankovitch cycles. They have a period of approximately 20, 40 and 100 kyr. Over the past million years or so, the 100 kyr period has been dominant and this has resulted in large variations in the Earth's climate with that periodicity. These variations are, however, quite asymmetric with the cooling taking place over 80 kyr while the warming is much more abrupt.

## Evidence for erosion

These variations have led to the formation of glaciers in many mountain belts that undergo cycles of growth (and sometimes birth and death) over a period of approximately 100 kyr. In many mountain areas, these glaciers have a wet base and are therefore sliding on the underlying bedrock. This sliding has caused carving of the bedrock by the ice that has given many of the Earth's current monutain belts a distinct character. This include the formation of U-shaped valleys, cirques, aretes and hanging valleys.

## Chicken and egg debate

There is an on-going debate {cite:p}`Molnar1990,Herman2013Nature,Schildgen2018Nature` on whether the cooling of the Quaternary and the apparition of glaciers in mountain belts has enhanced the "erosional efficiency" of the Earth's hydrosphere, which in turn, could have caused an uplift of mountain belt by flexural {term}`isostasy`. This debate highlights the need to better understand and quantify the efficiency of glacial erosion and how it compares to that of fluvial erosion. This is one of the reasons why many models of glacial erosion have been developed in recent years. They differ mostly by the way they solve the equation governing the distribution of ice on a landscape.

## Glacial erosion law

However, unlike for the Stream Power Law (SPL), a consensus seems to emerge on the value of the parameters representing the glacial erosion law, which implies that the erosion rate that they predict are better calibrated than those derived from the SPL.

Here we will present the main parameterization for glacial erosion, the various models that have been developed to model ice flow at the Earth's surface and some of the constraints that we have on the value of the glacial erosion model parameters.
