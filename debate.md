# Debate

At this point you must have a clearer picture on how the four papers you have read contribute to the debate on the control of mountain topography on Earth. You should be ready to synthesize this in a short paper/presentation. To help you in this endeavour, I provide you here with a few hints.

`````{admonition} Tips

````{tab-set}

```{tab-item} Contradictions
Are they obvious contradictions between the four papers? To answer this question, analyze the papers by pairs and see if their main conclusions are compatible?
```

```{tab-item} Hypotheses
Can these contradictions be explained by differences in hypotheses made by the authors? Are they all justified? Are some hypotheses better than others? Are there some that are better adapted to given circumstances or environments?
```

```{tab-item} Cross-reference
Is there cross-referencing among the papers? Do you see a temporal evolution or a "history" about the debate?
```

```{tab-item} Future work
Can you think of a logical study that could be done to contribute to the debate? or potentially resolve it? Think of your reading as a preparatory phase for you writing a grant for a new project that you want to get funding for. What would be that project's abstract?
```

```{tab-item} Models
To perform that future/additional work or address the debate, is there an obvious model that should be used or developed? What would you test with it?
