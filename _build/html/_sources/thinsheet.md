# Thin sheet model

The thin sheet model is based on a simplified version of the Stokes equation that governs the flow of highly viscous (inertia-free) fluids.

It is commonly used to model tectonic processes at the scale of the plates. Its main limitations are that it can only  accurately represents deformation that takes place at a horizontal scale that is larger than the plate thickness and that it uses depth averaged properties for the plate.

To derive the equation governing the deformation of a thin viscous plate, we proceed in two steps. First we derive the general form of Stokes equation that governs the flow of a viscous, incompressible and inertia free fluid. Second, we introduce the simplifications that will lead to the thin sheet approximation.

This procedure is inspired (or is a summarized version of) the derivation given in {cite:t}`england1982thin-224`.
