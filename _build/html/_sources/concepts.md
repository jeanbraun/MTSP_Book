# Some basic concepts

This course relates to the use of numerical modeling as a tool to address basic questions about the Earth's behaviour and, in particular, about how tectonics, climate and rheology potentially all contribute to controlling the height of mountain topography on Earth. {term}`Numerical model`s use numerical methods that are used to solve {term}`partial differential equation`s. We will not study all of these methods but focus on a few of them and, most importantly, on another tool that is commonly used to understand the behaviour of PDEs as a function of model parameter and bounday condition values, namely a dimensional analysis, which leads to the definition of dimensionless numbers.

For this, we will need to introduce a couple of partial differential equations, namely the Stokes equation and the stream power law, as well as other basic physical principles, such as the concept of isostasy.
