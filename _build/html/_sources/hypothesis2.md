# Hypothesis 2

The second hypothesis is explained in the paper by {cite:t}`Whipple1999JournalofGeophysicalResearchSolidEarth19782012`.

This hypothesis is derived from the behaviour (and the solution) of a partial differential equation governing river incision in bedrock in a region experiencing uniform uplift. This article describes how the equation (the [Stream Power Law](spl-section)) is derived but also its implications for the height of mountain belts.

```{tab-item} Erosion number
The authors use the Stream Power Incision Model (SPIM) - or Stream Power Law (SPL) - to derive a [dimensionless number](dimension-section), the Erosion number, $\mathbf{N_E}$. Can you understand the way it has been derived? Can you explain what it measures?

```{tab-item} River profiles
What is Hack's law? What is the "canonic" shape of a steady-state river profile resulting from the balance between tectonic uplift and river erosion? What does it depend on?
```

```{tab-item} Knick points
What is a knick point? Is it observed in nature? Can it be explained by the SPL? How does it propagates?

What is the contribution of this paper to the debate concerning the height of mountain belts? What is the main hypothesis that they contribute to? Can you complete the following statement:
