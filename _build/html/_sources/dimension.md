# Dimensionless numbers

{term}`Dimensionless numbers <dimensionless number>` are derived from the coefficients of a PDE ({term}`partial differential equation <partial differential equation>`) and its boundary conditions. They correspond to ratios of two or more processes represented by the equation. Their derivation requires the definition of dimensionless variables and quantities.

To illustrate how they are derived from the equation and how useful they are to quantify the behaviour of the equation, I present here an example using the heat diffusion advection equation.
