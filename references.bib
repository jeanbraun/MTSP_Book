  abstract = {Improved formulation of bedrock erosion laws requires knowledge of the actual processes operative at the bed. We present qualitative field evidence from a wide range of settings that the relative efficacy of the various processes of fluvial erosion (e.g., plucking, abrasion, cavitation, solution) is a strong function of substrate lithology, and that joint spacing, fractures, and bedding planes exert the most direct control. The relative importance of the various processes and the nature of the interplay between them are inferred from detailed observations of the morphology of erosional forms on channel bed and banks, and their spatial distributions. We find that plucking dominates wherever rocks are well jointed on a submeter scale. Hydraulic wedging of small clasts into cracks, bashing and abrasion by bedload, and chemical and physical weathering all contribute to the loosening and removal of joint blocks. In more massive rocks, abrasion by suspended sand appears to be rate limiting in the systems studied here. Concentration of erosion on downstream sides of obstacles and tight coupling between fluid-flow patterns and fine-scale morphology of erosion forms testify to the importance of abrasion by suspended-load, rather than bedload, particles. Mechanical analyses indicate that erosion by suspended-load abrasion is considerably more nonlinear in shear stress than erosion by plucking. In addition, a new analysis indicates that cavitation is more likely to occur in natural systems than previously argued. Cavitation must be considered a viable process in many actively incising bedrock channels and may contribute to the fluting and potholing of massive, unjointed rocks that is otherwise attributed to suspended-load abrasion. Direct field evidence of cavitation erosion is, however, lacking. In terms of the well-known shear-stress (or stream-power) erosion law, erosion by plucking is consistent with a slope exponent (n) of ∼2/3 to 1, whereas erosion by suspended-load abrasion is more consistent with a slope exponent of ∼5/3. Given that substrate lithology appears to dictate the dominant erosion process, this finding has important implications for long-term landscape evolution and the models used to study it.},

  abstract = {The longitudinal profiles of bedrock channels are a major component of the relief structure of mountainous drainage basins and therefore limit the elevation of peaks and ridges. Further, bedrock channels communicate tectonic and climatic signals across the landscape, thus dictating, to first order, the dynamic response of mountainous landscapes to external forcings. We review and explore the stream-power erosion model in an effort to (1) elucidate its consequences in terms of large-scale topographic (fluvial) relief and its sensitivity to tectonic and climatic forcing, (2) derive a relationship for system response time to tectonic perturbations, (3) determine the sensitivity of model behavior to various model parameters, and (4) integrate the above to suggest useful guidelines for further study of bedrock channel systems and for future refinement of the streampower erosion law. Dimensional analysis reveals that the dynamic behavior of the stream-power erosion model is governed by a single nondimensional group that we term the uplift-erosion number, greatly reducing the number of variables that need to be considered in the sensitivity analysis. The degree of nonlinearity in the relationship between stream incision rate and channel gradient (slope exponent n) emerges as a fundamental unknown. The physics of the active erosion processes directly influence this nonlinearity, which is shown to dictate the relationship between the uplift-erosion number, the equilibrium stream channel gradient, and the total fluvial relief of mountain ranges. Similarly, the predicted response time to changes in rock uplift rate is shown to depend on climate, rock strength, and the magnitude of tectonic perturbation, with the slope exponent n controlling the degree of dependence on these various factors. For typical drainage basin geometries the response time is relatively insensitive to the size of the system. Work on the physics of bedrock erosion processes, their sensitivity to extreme floods, their transient responses to sudden changes in climate or uplift rate, and the scaling of local rock erosion studies to reach-scale modeling studies are most sorely needed.},

To bridge this gap between short‐term hydrology and long‐term geomorphology, we derive a theoretical framework for long‐term fluvial erosion rates driven by realistic climate by integrating an established stochastic‐mechanistic model of hydrology into a threshold‐stochastic formulation of stream power. The hydrological theory provides equations for the daily streamflow probability distribution as a function of climatic boundary conditions. The new parameters introduced are rooted firmly in established climatic and hydrological theory. This allows us to account for how fluvial erosion rates respond to changes in rainfall intensity, frequency, evapotranspiration rates, and soil moisture dynamics in a way that is consistent with existing theories. We use this framework to demonstrate how hydroclimatic conditions and erosion threshold magnitude control the degree of nonlinearity between steepness index and erosion rate. We find that hydrological processes can have a significant influence on how erosive a particular climatic forcing will be. By accounting for the influence of hydrology on fluvial erosion, we conclude that climate is an important control on erosion rates and long‐term landscape evolution. Integration of hydrology into a stream power model yields new insight into climatic controls on fluvial erosion efficiency The nonlinearity between the steepness index and erosion rate is controlled by erosion thresholds, hydroclimatic conditions, and channel hydraulics Hydrology influences how erosive a particular climate forcing will be},

However, mounting evidence indicates that a significant proportion of Earth's topography results from the viscous stresses created by flow within the underlying mantle, rather than by the moving plates. This dynamic topography is transient, varying as mantle flow changes, and is characterized by small amplitudes and long wavelengths. It is therefore often hidden by or confused with the more obvious topographic anomalies resulting from horizontal tectonic movements. However, dynamic topography can influence surface processes and thus enter the geological record; it has, for example, played a role in the establishment of Amazon drainage patterns. In turn, surface processes such as the erosion of topographical anomalies could affect mantle flow. This emerging view of dynamic topography suggests that the concept of plate tectonics as the driver of surface deformation needs to be extended to include the vertical coupling between the mantle and the surface. Unravelling this coupling back in time with the help of models and the geological record can potentially provide unprecedented insights into past mantle dynamics.},

  abstract = {For the purposes of describing its large-scale and long-term deformation, the continental lithosphere is regarded as a continuum, obeying a Newtonian or a power law rheology. The flow of a thin sheet of power law material overlying an inviscid substrate is studied under the assumption that vertical gradients of the horizontal velocity are negligible. A numerical model is used to investigate the deformation of such a sheet under conditions approximating those of continent—continent collision. The material flows in response to forces applied to its boundaries (for example, the indenting of one continent by another) and to forces in its interior arising from gradients in crustal thickness. The horizontal divergence of the flow produces changes in the crustal thickness and hence a time-dependent form to the flow itself. For a given set of boundary conditions, the flow depends on the stress exponent in the power law rheology, n, and on the Argand number Ar, which is a measure of the ratio between the stress arising from crustal thickness contrasts and the stress required to deform the material at the ambient strain rates. When the effective viscosity of the medium is very high (Ar→0), crustal thickness variations do not influence the flow. If the material is Newtonian (n=1), the deformation associated with an influx of material (approximating an indenter) is of much greater lateral dimension than the width of the indenter, whereas when material has a power law rheology (n=3, 5 are used), the deformation is confined to a region of lateral extent comparable to that of the indenter. As Ar increases, the forces arising from crustal thickness contrasts exert more influence on the flow, and the maximum crustal thickness that can be sustained by a given influx of material is related by a simple expression to the effective viscosity of the medium at the ambient strain rates. In the limit of a very weak medium (Ar > 10) the lithosphere is unable to sustain appreciable crustal elevation contrasts. The results of these numerical experiments show that systems in which the effective viscosities are such that the maximum deviatoric stresses are between 1 kbar and 100 bar have crustal thickness distributions comparable to that in the India—Asia collision zone. In addition, these systems have the characteristic that the forces arising from crustal thickness contrasts are great enough to produce net extension in the region of thick crust in front of the influx boundary, perpendicular to the direction of influx, as well as lateral movement away from the region of thickest crust. Observations of contemporary tectonics in Asia show phenomena very similar to these, in the active east—west extension of Tibet and the eastward motion of eastern Tibet.},

However, whether surface processes or lithospheric strength control mountain belt height, shape and longevity remains uncertain. Additionally, how to reconcile high erosion rates in some active orogens with long-term survival of mountain belts for hundreds of millions of years remains enigmatic. Here we investigate mountain belt growth and decay using a new coupled surface process5,6 and mantle-scale tectonic model7. End-member models and the new non-dimensional Beaumont number, Bm, quantify how surface processes and tectonics control the topographic evolution of mountain belts, and enable the definition of three end-member types of growing orogens: type 1, non-steady state, strength controlled (Bm > 0.5); type 2, flux steady state8, strength controlled (Bm ≈ 0.4−0.5); and type 3, flux steady state, erosion controlled (Bm < 0.4). Our results indicate that tectonics dominate in Himalaya–Tibet and the Central Andes (both type 1), efficient surface processes balance high convergence rates in Taiwan (probably type 2) and surface processes dominate in the Southern Alps of New Zealand (type 3). Orogenic decay is determined by erosional efficiency and can be subdivided into two phases with variable isostatic rebound characteristics and associated timescales. The results presented here provide a unified framework explaining how surface processes and lithospheric strength control the height, shape, and longevity of mountain belts. Using the new Beaumont number presented, it is concluded that the topographic evolution of collisional mountain belts is determined by the combination of plate velocity, crustal rheology and surface process efficiency.},

Tectonic deformation and surface denudation are interdependent, however, and feedback mechanisms—in particular, the potential link to climate—are subjects of intense debate1, 2. Spatial variations in fluvial denudation rate caused by precipitation gradients are known to provide first-order controls on mountain range width, crustal deformation rates and rock uplift3, 4. Moreover, limits to crustal strength5 are thought to constrain the maximum elevation of large continental plateaus, such as those in Tibet and the central Andes. There are indications that the general height of mountain ranges is also directly influenced by the extent of glaciation through an efficient denudation mechanism known as the glacial buzzsaw6, 7, 8, 9. Here we use a global analysis of topography and show that variations in maximum mountain height correlate closely with climate-controlled gradients in snowline altitude for many high mountain ranges across orogenic ages and tectonic styles. With the aid of a numerical model, we further demonstrate how a combination of erosional destruction of topography above the snowline by glacier-sliding and commensurate isostatic landscape uplift caused by erosional unloading can explain observations of maximum mountain height by driving elevations towards an altitude window just below the snowline. The model thereby self-consistently produces the hypsometric signature of the glacial buzzsaw, and suggests that differences in the height of mountain ranges mainly reflect variations in local climate rather than tectonic forces.},

Density anomalies within or just beneath the lithosphere constitute major sources for tectonic stress fields: the product of their magnitude by their depth is shown to characterize their ability to induce deformation. This rule of the density moment directly yields the lithospheric thickening or thinning rate when applied to structures of large lateral extent. For anomalies of lateral extent that is small in comparison with their depth, the deformation is vertically inhomogeneous and has been computed with the help of simple physical models of a stratified viscous Newtonian lithosphere. The analytical treatment is based on Fourier transform. Continent‐continent collision thickens not only the crust but the entire lithosphere. The cold root underlying a mountain chain induces strong regional compressive stresses able to sustain the mountain bulding process without further help from forces transmitted from far away. Thus the continental lithosphere is in a somewhat metastable mechanical state. Adiabatic, i.e. rapid, thickening (or thinning) tends to grow further once initiated. Tectonic phases of strong compression correspond to the climax of such instabilities. The response of models with cold lithospheric roots of various intensities has been computed both in two and three dimensions. They yield velocity distributions and stress fields. Instructive comparisons are made with earthquake focal mechanisms and in situ stress measurements in the Alpine and Appalachian regions. In the presence of lateral variations of the mechanical properties of the lithosphere, the tectonic style is not only function of the local topography and of the nature of its compensation. Deformations in neighbouring provinces are coupled as shown by 3‐dimensional models. For example, thickening sustained by a cold lithospheric root may generate extension in peripheral zones of weakness. These last results illustrate the point that the computation of regional tectonic stresses requires the knowledge of the density anomalies within the lithosphere on the one hand, and of geometrical constraints related to lateral mechanical heterogeneities on the other.},

  abstract = {Modelling the geoid has been a widely used and successful approach in constraining flow and viscosity in the Earth's mantle. However, details of the viscosity structure cannot be tightly constrained with this approach. Here, radial viscosity variations in four to five mantle layers (lithosphere, upper mantle, one to two transition zone layers, lower mantle) are computed with the aid of independent mineral physics results. A density model is obtained by converting s‐wave anomalies from seismic tomography to density anomalies. Assuming both are of thermal origin, conversion factors are computed based on mineral physics results. From the density and viscosity model, a model of mantle flow, and the resulting geoid and radial heat flux profile are computed. Absolute viscosity values in the mantle layers are treated as free parameters and determined by minimizing a misfit function, which considers fit to geoid, ‘Haskell average’ determined from post‐glacial rebound and the radial heat flux profile and penalizes if at some depth computed heat flux exceeds the estimated mantle heat flux 33 {TW}. Typically, optimized models do not exceed this value by more than about 20 per cent and fit the Haskell average well. Viscosity profiles obtained show a characteristic hump in the lower mantle, with maximum viscosities of about 1023 Pa s just above the D″ layer— several hundred to about 1000 times the lowest viscosities in the upper mantle. This viscosity contrast is several times higher than what is inferred when a constant lower mantle viscosity is assumed. The geoid variance reduction obtained is up to about 80 per cent—similar to previous results. However, because of the use of mineral physics constraints, a rather small number of free model parameters is required, and at the same time, a reasonable heat flux profile is obtained. Results are best when the lowest viscosities occur in the transition zone. When viscosity is lowest in the asthenosphere, variance reduction is about 70–75 per cent. Best results were obtained with a viscous lithosphere with a few times 1022 Pa s. The optimized models yield a core‐mantle boundary excess ellipticity several times higher than observed, possibly indicating that radial stresses are partly compensated due to non‐thermal lateral variations within the lowermost mantle.},

However, the effect of cooling during the Late Cenozoic era, including the onset of Pliocene-Pleistocene Northern Hemisphere glaciation (about two to three million years ago), on global erosion rates remains unclear. The uncertainty arises mainly from a lack of consensus on the use of the sedimentary record as a proxy for erosion and the difficulty of isolating the respective contributions of tectonics and climate to erosion. Here we compile 18,000 bedrock thermochronometric ages from around the world and use a formal inversion procedure to estimate temporal and spatial variations in erosion rates. This allows for the quantification of erosion for the source areas that ultimately produce the sediment record on a timescale of millions of years. We find that mountain erosion rates have increased since about six million years ago and most rapidly since two million years ago. The increase of erosion rates is observed at all latitudes, but is most pronounced in glaciated mountain ranges, indicating that glacial processes played an important part. Because mountains represent a considerable fraction of the global production of sediments, our results imply an increase in sediment flux at a global scale that coincides closely with enhanced cooling during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs.},

A global increase in late-Cenozoic erosion rates in response to a cooling, more variable climate has been proposed on the basis of worldwide sedimentation rates7. Other studies have indicated, however, that global erosion rates may have remained steady, suggesting that the reported increases in sediment-accumulation rates are due to preservation biases, depositional hiatuses and varying measurement intervals8–10. More recently, a global compilation of thermochronology data has been used to infer a nearly twofold increase in the erosion rate in mountainous landscapes over late-Cenozoic times6. It has been contended that this result is free of the biases that affect sedimentary records11, although others have argued that it contains biases related to how thermochronological data are averaged12 and to erosion hiatuses in glaciated landscapes13. Here we investigate the 30 locations with reported accelerated erosion during the late Cenozoic6. Our analysis shows that in 23 of these locations, the reported increases are a result of a spatial correlation bias—that is, combining data with disparate exhumation histories, thereby converting spatial erosion-rate variations into temporal increases. In four locations, the increases can be explained by changes in tectonic boundary conditions. In three cases, climatically induced accelerations are recorded, driven by localized glacial valley incision. Our findings suggest that thermochronology data currently have insufficient resolution to assess whether late-Cenozoic climate change affected erosion rates on a global scale. We suggest that a synthesis of local findings that include location-specific information may help to further investigate drivers of global erosion rates. Reported acceleration of erosion in mountainous landscapes during the late Cenozoic is the result of combining thermochronology data with disparate exhumation histories, thereby converting spatial variations in erosion rates into temporal increases.},

The analysis, which is constructed within a framework of modern glaciological views of processes near to the bed, is aimed at modeling abrasion under a temperate glacier whose basal layers contain only occasional rock fragments. It does not simulate abrasion by debris-rich ice or by subglacial drift. Calculations of abrasion-rates reduce to evaluations of the forces pressing rock fragments against the glacier bed and of the rates at which they are moved along the bed. The estimated viscous drag induced by ice flow toward the bed due to basal melting is generally the dominant contribution to this contact force. Although the analysis shares several important elements with the pioneering study of Boulton ([ c 1974]), sufficient fundamental differences in the modeling lead to distinctly different conclusions. Several new results are noteworthy: (1) other parameters being equal, abrasion will tend to be fastest where basal melting is most rapid, (2) glacier thickness does not affect abrasion through its influence on basal pressures, and (3) lodgement of rock fragments is only possible if the sliding velocity is very low, equivalent to the rate of basal melting.},

It proved difficult to simulate-satisfactorily the entire geometry of the present-day ice cap. Nevertheless, it was possible to simulate a steady-state ice cap whose volume and areal extent approximate the (estimated) current situation. Several experiments have indicated that this state is highly sensitive to climate change.

Localized flow rate undulations generate longitudinal and transverse stress gradients within the ice, which, in turn, are of known importance to the flow itself, whether by internal deformation of the ice or by basal sliding, and to the interaction with topography through glacial erosion. Standard models capable of simulating mountain range–scale glaciations build on the so-called shallow ice approximation, which, among other parameters, neglects the longitudinal and transverse stress gradients, and therefore fails to capture the full effects of the rugged topography and related feedbacks between erosion by glacial sliding and the extent and style of glaciation. Here we present and test a new depth-integrated model framework which, on the one hand, takes into account the “higher-order” effects related to steep and rugged bed topography while it still, on the other hand, provides the computational efficiency needed for three-dimensional simulations of glaciation and landscape evolution in response to, for example, long-term climate variations. The model framework (integrated second-order shallow ice approximation ({iSOSIA})) is based on depth integration of the second-order shallow ice approximation. Although depth integration is not guaranteed to maintain so-called second-order accuracy, the results of computational benchmark experiments show that {iSOSIA}, in spite of its efficient depth-integrated structure, performs well in situations with steep and rapidly undulating bed topography.},

  abstract = {Glaciers and ice sheets store nearly 70\% of the world's freshwater and would raise sea level by around 70 m if they melted. They are, thus, an important component of the global water cycle. Their role in climate can be assessed through current responses to global warming and their influence on the environment during periods of glaciation. At the Last Glacial Maximum, ∼21 000 years ago, the glacial cover caused sea level to be 115 to 130 m lower than at present. The climate of Ice Age Earth was affected in many ways by ice sheets. First, the expansion of ice sheets caused huge changes to the surface albedo and, hence, the radiation budget of the planet. Second, the orography of North America and Eurasia was altered significantly by large ice sheets, which had implications for atmospheric flow. Third, as the ice sheets grew and decayed, the influx of freshwater to the oceans, and in particular the North Atlantic, affected the ocean circulation, which in turn affected climate. The result of this ice–ocean–atmosphere interaction was large‐scale short‐term oscillations in air temperatures, which have been recorded in Greenland ice cores. The ice and climate processes identified for the glacial cycle are relevant today. For example, the Greenland ice sheet is currently melting at its southern margin, and releasing freshwater to the North Atlantic. Importantly, global temperatures were a few degrees higher in the previous interglacial, and the Greenland ice sheet was about half its current size. As global warming continues, the response of the Greenland ice sheet could be to return to its Eemian configuration. Although far smaller in volume, glaciers respond much quicker to climate change than do ice sheets. In the last century, most have experienced decay, and the runoff generated has been estimated to account for at least 10\% of the 15 to 20 cm of sea‐level rise measured (see Mass and Energy Balances of Glaciers and Ice Sheets,). In combination, glacier and ice‐sheet melting may send large quantities of water into the oceans, some of it rapidly. This could have serious implications for the climate of the North Atlantic and, through teleconnection, the world.}

  abstract = {Glacial erosion is fundamental to our understanding of the role of Cenozoic-era climate change in the development of topography worldwide, yet the factors that control the rate of erosion by ice remain poorly understood. In many tectonically active mountain ranges, glaciers have been inferred to be highly erosive, and conditions of glaciation are used to explain both the marked relief typical of alpine settings and the limit on mountain heights above the snowline, that is, the glacial buzzsaw. In other high-latitude regions, glacial erosion is presumed to be minimal, where a mantle of cold ice effectively protects landscapes from erosion. Glacial erosion rates are expected to increase with decreasing latitude, owing to the climatic control on basal temperature and the production of meltwater, which promotes glacial sliding, erosion and sediment transfer. This relationship between climate, glacier dynamics and erosion rate is the focus of recent numerical modelling, yet it is qualitative and lacks an empirical database. Here we present a comprehensive data set that permits explicit examination of the factors controlling glacier erosion across climatic regimes. We report contemporary ice fluxes, sliding speeds and erosion rates inferred from sediment yields from 15 outlet glaciers spanning 19 degrees of latitude from Patagonia to the Antarctic Peninsula. Although this broad region has a relatively uniform tectonic and geologic history, the thermal regimes of its glaciers range from temperate to polar. We find that basin-averaged erosion rates vary by three orders of magnitude over this latitudinal transect. Our findings imply that climate and the glacier thermal regime control erosion rates more than do extent of ice cover, ice flux or sliding speeds.},

Developing erosion theories is challenging because of the complex nature of the erosion processes and the difficulty of examining the ice/bedrock interface of contemporary glaciers. We demonstrate that the glacial erosion rate is proportional to the ice-sliding velocity squared, by quantifying spatial variations in ice-sliding velocity and the erosion rate of a fast-flowing Alpine glacier. The nonlinear behavior implies a high erosion sensitivity to small variations in topographic slope and precipitation. A nonlinear rate law suggests that abrasion may dominate over other erosion processes in fast-flowing glaciers. It may also explain the wide range of observed glacial erosion rates and, in part, the impact of glaciation on mountainous landscapes during the past few million years.},

Here we constrain the shear force along active megathrusts using their rheological properties and then determine the tectonically supported elevation using a force balance model. We show that the height of mountain ranges around the globe matches this elevation, irrespective of climatic conditions and the rate of erosion. This finding indicates that mountain ranges are close to force equilibrium and that their height is primarily controlled by the megathrust shear force. We conclude that temporal variations in mountain height reflect long-term changes in the force balance but are not indicative of a direct climate control on mountain elevation. Simulations using a force balance model match mountain heights observed around the globe, suggesting that mountain elevation is almost completely controlled by tectonic forces rather than erosion.},

  abstract = {A numerical model of the coupled processes of tectonic deformation and surface erosion in convergent orogens is developed to investigate the nature of the interaction between these processes. Crustal deformation is calculated by a two-dimensional finite element model of deformation in response to subduction and accretion of continental crust. Erosion operates on the uplifted surface of this model through fluvial incision which is taken to be proportional to stream power. The relative importance of the tectonic and erosion processes is given by a dimensionless “erosion number” relating convergence velocity, rock erodibility, and precipitation rate. This number determines the time required for a system to reach steady state and the final topographic shape and size of a mountain belt. Fundamental characteristics of the model orogens include asymmetric topography with shallower slopes facing the subducting plate and an asymmetric pattern of exhumation with the deepest levels of exhumation opposite to subduction. These characteristics are modified when the regional climate exhibits a dominant wind direction and orographically enhanced precipitation on one side of the mountain belt. The two possible cases are dominant wind in the direction of motion of the subducting plate and dominant wind direction in the opposite direction of the subducting plate velocity. Models of the former case predict a broad zone of exhumation with maximum exhumation in the orogen interior. Models of the latter case predict a focused zone of exhumation at the margin of the orogen and, at high erosion number, a reversal in the topographic asymmetry. Natural examples of these two cases are presented. The Southern Alps of New Zealand exhibits the climate and exhumation asymmetry characteristic of wind in the direction opposite to motion of the subducting plate. The asymmetry of topography suggests that erosion is not efficient enough to have reversed the topographic asymmetry. The contrasting example of dominant wind in the direction of subduction motion is provided by the Olympic Mountains of Washington State. In this case, exhumation of deep levels of the Cascadia accretionary wedge shows a broad domal pattern consistent with the observed orographic precipitation.},

It has been proposed that climate change might have driven the uplift of mountain summits through an isostatic response to valley incision. Because isostasy acts to compensate mean elevations, the debate hinges on the question of whether climate change can significantly increase topographic relief or, more precisely, increase the volume of 'missing mass' between summits and ridges. Here we show that, in tectonically active mountain ranges, geomorphic constraints allow only a relatively small increase in topographic relief in response to climate change. Thus, although climate change may cause significant increases in denudation rates, potentially establishing an important feedback between surficial and crustal processes, neither fluvial nor glacial erosion is likely to induce significant isostatic peak uplift.},

We used 10Be abundance in river sands and topographic analysis to test this relationship in watersheds varying by four orders of magnitude in erosion rate (4.7 × 10–3–7.1 mm yr−1), and supplemented this with a global analysis of erosion rates and topography. Our data and analyses reveal that in steep, rapidly eroding landscapes, channel morphology does not scale with erosion rate as expected. Instead, river profiles reach a threshold steepness, which may provide a bound on the topographic relief of Earth. In this case, increases in channel length may limit topographic relief, as erosion rate becomes increasingly sensitive to small changes in channel slopes in steep landscapes. The channel morphology of rapidly eroding landscapes does not scale with river erosion rates, according to isotopic and topographic analysis.},

Models in which rheological properties do not change with depth or temperature are characterized by growth of back-to-back wedges above the subduction zone. Wedge taper is inversely dependent on the Ramberg number (Rm; gravity stress/basal traction); increasing convergence velocity or crustal strength produces narrower and thicker wedges. Models that are characterized by a decrease in crustal viscosity from ηc to ηb with depth or temperature, leading to partial or full basal decoupling of the crust from the mantle, display more complex behaviour. For models with a moderate viscosity ratio, ηb/ηc∼ 10−1, the crustal wedges have dual tapers with a lower taper in the central region and a higher taper at the edges of the deformed crust. A reduction in the viscosity ratio (ηb/ηc∼ 10−2) is sufficient to cause a transition of the central wedge region to a plateau. This transition depends on the basal traction, therefore the thickness of the weak basal layer also affects the transition. Further reduction of the viscosity ratio (ηb/ηc∼ 10−4) leads to full basal decoupling and the development of plateaux in all cases considered. In most models, the plateaux grow laterally at constant thickness between characteristic edge peaks associated with the transitions from coupled to decoupled lower crust. Where the crust is fully decoupled, large-scale model geometries for both depth- and temperature-dependent rheologies are similar with gravity-driven flow concentrated in the low-viscosity region. However, strong lateral temperature gradients within these models, controlled by the interaction of horizontal and vertical thermal advection, diffusion and heterogeneous thickening of the radioactive crustal layer, lead to differences in the velocity and deformation fields between the two cases, particularly at the plateau margins. The results suggest that simple depth-dependent viscosity models may be reasonable approximations for describing the large-scale geometry of fully developed plateaux, but that they are not appropriate for describing the internal features of large orogenic systems or the transition from wedge to plateau geometry.},
