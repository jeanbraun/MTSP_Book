This hypothesis is derived from the results obtained by coupling a sophisticated thermo-mechanical model of the {term}`lithosphere` and underlying mantle solving the [Stokes equation](stokes-section), to a landscape evolution model solving the [Stream Power Law](spl-section) (SPL). The results are interpreted by introducing a dimensionless number, the Beaumont number, $\mathbf{Bm}$.
